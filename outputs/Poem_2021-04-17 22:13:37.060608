be the praise. o, how thy beauties wear, thy dial 
how thy worth with manners may i dare to boast 
how i do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds in 
singleness the parts that thou among the wastes of time 
must go, since sweets and out for women's pleasure, mine 
be thy widow and still weep that thou teachest how 
to make me give the lie to my thoughts
